Quantitative studies of disparate impact face two key challenges:

1. **_Omitted_-variable bias** occurs when an analyst omits relevant variables,
   like a job applicant's work history, in their regression model.
2. **_Included_-variable bias** occurs when a researcher includes variables
   in their regression model that are not relevant to the outcome of interest,
   like a job applicant's height. These variables can mask the relevance of
   gender, race, or other protected attributes.

The `rar` package supports risk-adjusted regression, a framework for mitigating
included-variable bias. It computes risk-adjusted disparities and performs an
interpretable sensitivity analysis that can be used to assess the robustness of
regression results to omitted-variable bias. See
["Mitigating Included- and Omitted-Variable Bias in Estimates of Disparate"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.05651)
for more details.

## Installation

You can install the latest stable release of `rar` from CRAN with:

``` r
install.packages("rar")
```

You can install the development version of `rar` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jgaeb/rar")
```

## Example

To perform risk-adjusted regression, use the `sens()` function.

```{r example}
library(rar)

# Generate some data
set.seed(1)
df <- tibble::tibble(
  group = factor(
    sample(c("a", "b"), 1000, replace = TRUE),
    levels = c("a", "b")
  ),
  p = runif(1000)^2,
  frisked = runif(1000) < p + 0.1 * (group != "a")
)

# Compute risk-adjusted regression coefficients and perform sensitivity analysis
sens(df, group, frisked, p, "a", 0.1, eta = 0.001, m = 10)
```
